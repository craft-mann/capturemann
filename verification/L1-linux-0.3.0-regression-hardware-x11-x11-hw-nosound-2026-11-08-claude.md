## Steps

| Case | Result | Notes |

| `pkg.files` | PASS | the package holds the programs, FFmpeg, the helper and the licences |
| `pkg.startup` | PASS | every program starts without a crash (illegal instruction, fast fail) |
| `pkg.diagnostics` | PASS | diagnostics reports app, system, models and engines, FFmpeg and the helper |
| `daemon.lifecycle` | PASS | daemon starts on a private endpoint, answers, stops, and the endpoint is gone |
| `daemon.library_created` | PASS | a fresh library is created and lists no captures; no helper program runs while idle |
| `daemon.second_instance` | PASS | a second daemon on a busy endpoint exits cleanly and leaves the first one working |
| `daemon.autostart` | PASS | the CLI starts a daemon when none runs |
| `settings.roundtrip` | PASS | settings set and get round trip, and survive a daemon restart |
| `settings.app_only_refused` | PASS | app-only settings keys are refused to agents and change nothing |
| `targets.list` | PASS | targets lists displays and windows with readable names and real sizes |
| `shot.display` | PASS | a display screenshot is a valid PNG of the display's physical size |
| `shot.region` | PASS | a region screenshot has the requested size |

| `shot.invalid` | PASS | bad targets are refused with the shared error codes and create no capture |
| `lib.manifest` | PASS | the library lists a bundle; manifest.json has the schema keys; export of the image is a valid PNG |
| `lib.rename` | PASS | rename changes the title and the bundle folder, and is not an undo step |
| `lib.annotate_undo` | PASS | annotate adds a revision; undo and redo move through it; one call is one step |
| `lib.delete_needs_confirmation` | PASS | deleting a capture is refused without an on-screen confirmation and deletes nothing |
| `redact.fixture` | PASS | Auto-redact finds the e-mail address and the IPv4 address in a picture with known text |
| `redact.window_text` | PASS | Auto-redact on a screenshot of a real window that shows an e-mail address |

| `import.rotated` | PASS | a source with a rotation tag imports upright |
| `import.vfr` | PASS | a variable-frame-rate source gets a constant-rate editing copy (hardware H.264, or labelled software VP9 on Linux) |
| `import.audio` | PASS | a WAV file imports as an audio capture of the right length |
| `import.errors` | PASS | not a media file, a missing file, a file held open and a Unicode name end cleanly |

| `export.quick` | PASS | the quick export is H.264 MP4 of the right length, tagged BT.709 limited range |
| `export.presets` | PASS | youtube-1080p, vertical, square, webm and gif exports have the right codec, shape and length |
| `export.audio` | PASS | audio export to WAV and M4A has the right codec and length |
| `export.errors` | PASS | an unknown preset or capture is refused with the shared error codes |
| `mcp.handshake` | PASS | initialize answers with the server name, the product version and tool support |
| `mcp.tools_list` | PASS | tools/list matches the tool table of the spec (no drift either way) |
| `mcp.read_only_calls` | PASS | the read-only tools answer without error |
| `mcp.confirm_tier` | PASS | start_recording and delete_capture do not run without an on-screen confirmation |
| `mcp.policy_allow` | PASS | agents.tool_policy allow for start_recording is honoured by the daemon (CLI and MCP) |
| `mcp.request_id` | PASS | a repeated request_id returns the first result and acts once |
| `mcp.errors` | PASS | errors map to structuredContent.code, JSON-RPC codes and CLI exit codes |
| `mcp.events` | PASS | daemon events arrive as notifications (capture.revised, job.*) for changes any client makes |
| `mcp.cli_parity` | PASS | CLI and MCP return the same fields for library list, settings and targets |
| `mcp.http` | PASS | cm-mcp --http needs the bearer token and answers initialize |
| `rec.screen_cursor` | PASS | screen and cursor, pause and resume: H.264, constant 30 fps, 2 s key frames, right length, no warnings |
| `rec.region` | PASS | a region recording is exactly the requested size |
| `rec.region_min` | PASS | the smallest recording areas (18x18 and 20x20) record with the real encoder: exact size, frames present |
| `rec.kill9_recovery` | PASS | the daemon killed mid-recording: the next start recovers the bundle and loses under 3 s |
| `rec.mic` | PASS | a microphone track is recorded for the length of the recording |
| `rec.system_audio` | SKIP | system audio contains a tone played by another process: needs --allow sound |
| `rec.camera` | PASS | a camera track keeps at least 24 fps in a lit room |
| `rec.external_4k` | SKIP | 30 s of a 4K external monitor: a full-length file (with an encoder_overloaded warning) or full 30 fps: needs --allow second_monitor |
| `rec.each_monitor` | SKIP | 10 s of each monitor: the cursor header names that monitor's origin and size; friendly names, sprite sizes: not implemented for linux |
| `rec.soak` | SKIP | a long recording (--soak-minutes) keeps constant 30 fps and 2 s key frames: give --soak-minutes <n> to run a long recording |
| `ai.no_model` | PASS | without a model, transcribe and the text model say what to do (exit 2) instead of failing |
| `ai.llama_version` | PASS | the bundled llama-server runs --version and is not started by the daemon |
| `ai.transcribe` | SKIP | a transcription with a real model runs to the end without a crash: needs --whisper-model <ggml file> (and --speaker-models <dir> for the speaker case) |
| `ai.speakers` | SKIP | speaker labels: two voices give two speakers with the speaker models (--speech, --speaker-models): needs --whisper-model <ggml file> (and --speaker-models <dir> for the speaker case) |
| `installer.dmg` | SKIP | the DMG (or .app) installs into a temp folder: signature intact, programs work, removal leaves nothing: not implemented for linux |
| `installer.silent` | SKIP | silent install into a temp folder, the programs run, silent uninstall leaves nothing: not implemented for linux |
| `desktop.stays_up` | SKIP | cm-desktop starts, stays up for 10 s and leaves no crash event: not implemented for linux |
| `desktop.second_launch` | SKIP | a second launch with a file forwards it to the running app and exits: not implemented for linux |
| `desktop.hotkey_overlay` | SKIP | the screenshot hotkey (Ctrl+Alt+Shift+1; Option+Shift+1 on macOS) opens one overlay window per monitor on its exact rectangle; Esc ends it: not implemented for linux |
| `desktop.hud_click_through` | SKIP | during a recording the HUD answers clicks and the area window is click-through: not implemented for linux |
| `desktop.recording_banner` | PASS | Linux: during a recording the app shows its banner window and no floating HUD or screen-sized topmost window that would be in the video |
| `desktop.no_console_flash` | SKIP | no console window appears during import, export and a screenshot: not implemented for linux |
| `desktop.settings_applied` | PASS | settings set capture.delay_s (0, 3, 5 or 10) reaches the running app: a forwarded display capture waits that long |
| `desktop.recording_placement` | SKIP | countdown, area window and HUD of a recording of the external monitor appear on that monitor: not implemented for linux |
| `desktop.tray_icon` | SKIP | the tray icon appears in the notification area while the app runs (UI Automation probe): not implemented for linux |
| `linux.session` | PASS | the run sees a desktop session; the report names X11 or Wayland, the desktop and the portal |
| `linux.displays` | PASS | xrandr and the product list the same monitors |
| `linux.desktop_stays_up` | PASS | cm-desktop starts, stays up for 10 s and (X11) shows a window of its own |
| `linux.second_launch` | PASS | a second launch with a file forwards it to the running app and exits |
| `linux.tray_icon` | PASS | the tray icon registers as a StatusNotifierItem while the app runs |
| `linux.hotkey_overlay` | SKIP | the capture hotkey opens the overlay on every monitor: no global-shortcut path on GNOME 46 Wayland and the suite never injects keys into the lab laptop's session; the overlay is checked by hand (tests/manual/CAP-1-overlay.md) |
| `linux.vaapi_encoder` | PASS | VA-API (vainfo) and the product's diagnostics agree on hardware or software encoding |
| `linux.deb_install` | SKIP | the .deb installs, its programs find their libraries and run, remove and purge leave nothing: needs --installer <setup.exe> |
| `linux.tarball_install` | SKIP | the tarball installs into a temporary prefix, its programs run, --uninstall leaves nothing: needs --installer <setup.exe> |
| `regress.ffmpeg_missing_wording` | SKIP | with no FFmpeg anywhere the message says so in the platform's own words (no Homebrew on Windows): this system has an FFmpeg in a standard folder the suite cannot hide (- video encoder: hardware H.264 through VA-API (/dev/dri/renderD128) through ffm...) |
| `regress.encoder_unavailable_wording` | PASS | a recording the hardware encoder refuses ends with neutral wording and leaves no bundle |
| `zz.crash_events` | PASS | no crash of a CaptureMann program was logged (Windows event log, macOS DiagnosticReports) during the whole run |
